# Text-Based Adventure


#### _C#, .NET: Text-Based Adventure 9/26/2019_

## Description
Build a mini text-based adventure game that uses branching. Each branch should return a different response based on a user input.
Some "scenarios" can give users a clue on what input to enter next. Some responses should end the game while others lead to a new "scenario".

## Application should have:
- A custom `Game` class with a constructor that includes fields such as ``.

- Determine how the game's difficulty will change how a user can play the game. For instance, a user playing with a higher difficulty might get fewer chances to type an incorrect input. Hint: To do this, it will be necessary to store total attempts in the constructor.

- Allow users to pick up items that can affect the game later.
- Have separate methods for each scenario.
