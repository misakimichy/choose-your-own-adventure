# Text-Based Adventure


#### _C#, .NET: Text-Based Adventure 9/26/2019_

## Description
Build a mini text-based adventure game that uses branching. Each branch should return a different response based on a user input.
Some "scenarios" can give users a clue on what input to enter next. Some responses should end the game while others lead to a new "scenario".

## Application should have:
- A custom `Game` class with a constructor that includes fields.
- Use `goto` statement to escape from nested if statement.
- Allow users to pick up stories.
- Have separate methods for each scenario.
